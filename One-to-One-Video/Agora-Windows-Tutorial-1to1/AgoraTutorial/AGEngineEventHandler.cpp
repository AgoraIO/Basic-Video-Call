Live-broadcast profile: This callback notifies the application that the host joins the channel. If other hosts are already in the channel, the SDK also reports to the application on the existing hosts. We recommend limiting the number of hosts to 17.
The SDK triggers this callback under one of the following circumstances:

A remote user/host joins the channel by calling the joinChannel method.
A remote user switches the user role to the host by calling the setClientRole method after joining the channel.
A remote user/host rejoins the channel after a network interruption.
The host injects an online media stream into the channel by calling the addInjectStreamUrl method.
Note

The host receives this callback when another host joins the channel.
