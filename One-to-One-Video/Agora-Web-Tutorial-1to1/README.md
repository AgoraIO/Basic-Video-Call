# Web Tutorial - 1to1

*English | [中文](README.zh.md)*

This tutorial shows you how to quickly create an basic video communication using the Agora sample app.

With this sample app, you can:

- Join/Leave a realtime video call
- Select Camera/Microphone to use

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 6.9.1+
- A web server that supports SSL (https)

## Quick Start

This section shows you how to prepare, and run the sample application.

### Obtain an App ID

To build and run the sample application, get an App ID:
1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.
2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Save the **App ID** from the Dashboard for later use.
4. Generate a temp **Access Token** (valid for 24 hours) from dashboard page with given channel name, save for later use.

> To ensure communication security, Agora uses tokens (dynamic keys) to authenticate users joining a channel.
>
> Temporary tokens are for demonstration and testing purposes only and remain valid for 24 hours. In a production environment, you need to deploy your own server for generating tokens. See [Generate a Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive Broadcast/token_server)for details.

### Integrate Agora Video SDK

Download SDK into **assets** path and rename file name as **AgoraRTCSDK.js**

### Run Web-Server

1. Launch server via following commands in working folder,
    ```
    npx serve .
    ```
2. Enter Valid APPID, Token, Channel and click **JOIN**
