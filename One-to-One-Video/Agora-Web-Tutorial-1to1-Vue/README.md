Web Tutorial For Vue - 1to1

*English | [中文](README.zh.md)*

This code example shows how to quickly integrate basic one-to-one/one-to-many video calls

## Functions include:
1. Join the channel
2. Leave the channel
Among them, Appid, Channel must be filled, Token is optional
Video supports one to one, one to many calls

## To build and run the sample application, get an App ID:
1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.

2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.

3. Save the **App ID** from the Dashboard for later use.

4. Generate a temp **Access Token** (valid for 24 hours) from dashboard page with given channel name, save for later use.

   > To ensure communication security, Agora uses tokens (dynamic keys) to authenticate users joining a channel.
   >
   > Temporary tokens are for demonstration and testing purposes only and remain valid for 24 hours. In a production environment, you need to deploy your own server for generating tokens. See [Generate a Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive Broadcast/token_server)for details.
