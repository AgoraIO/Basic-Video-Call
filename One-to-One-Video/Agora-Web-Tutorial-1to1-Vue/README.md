Functions include:
1. Join the channel
2. Leave the channel
Among them, Appid, Channel must be filled, Token is optional
Video supports one to one, one to many calls

2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Save the **App ID** from the Dashboard for later use.
4. Generate a temp **Access Token** (valid for 24 hours) from dashboard page with given channel name, save for later use.
