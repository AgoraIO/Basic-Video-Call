     * Since
     *     v2.4.0. When you call the startAudioMixing method and the state of audio mixing file changes, the Agora SDK triggers this callback.
     *
     *         When the audio mixing file plays, pauses playing, or stops playing, this callback returns 710, 711, or 713 in state, and 0 in errorCode.
     *         When exceptions occur during playback, this callback returns 714 in state and an error in errorCode.
     *         If the local audio mixing file does not exist, or if the SDK does not support the file format or cannot access the music file URL, the SDK returns WARN_AUDIO_MIXING_OPEN_ERROR = 701.
     *
     * @param state The state code:
     *
     *     MEDIA_ENGINE_AUDIO_EVENT_MIXING_PLAY(710): the audio mixing file is playing.
     *     MEDIA_ENGINE_AUDIO_EVENT_MIXING_PAUSED(711): the audio mixing file pauses playing.
     *     MEDIA_ENGINE_AUDIO_EVENT_MIXING_STOPPED(713): the audio mixing file stops playing.
     *     MEDIA_ENGINE_AUDIO_EVENT_MIXING_ERROR(714): an exception occurs when playing the audio mixing file. See the errorCode for details.
     *
     * @param errorCode The error code:
     *
     *     MEDIA_ENGINE_AUDIO_ERROR_MIXING_OPEN(701): the SDK cannot open the audio mixing file.
     *     MEDIA_ENGINE_AUDIO_ERROR_MIXING_TOO_FREQUENT(702): the SDK opens the audio mixing file too frequently.
     *     MEDIA_ENGINE_AUDIO_EVENT_MIXING_INTERRUPTED_EOF(703): the audio mixing file playback is interrupted.
