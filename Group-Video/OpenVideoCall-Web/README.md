# Open Video Call for Web

*English | [中文](README.zh.md)*

This tutorial shows you how to quickly create an open video call using the Agora sample app.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 6.9.1+
- A web server that supports SSL (https)

## Quick Start

This section shows you how to prepare, build, and run the sample application.

### Obtain an App ID

To build and run the sample application, get an App ID:
1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.
2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Save the **App ID** from the Dashboard for later use.
4. Generate a temp **Access Token** (valid for 24 hours) from dashboard page with given channel name, save for later use.

5. Open the **src/utils/Settings.js** file. At the bottom of the file, replace `<#YOUR APP ID#>` with the App ID, and assign the token variable with the temp Access Token generated from dashboard.

    **Note:** Place the App ID/Token within single or double quotes.

    ```xml
    export const APP_ID = <#YOUR APP ID#>;

    // Assign Token to null if you have not enabled app certificate
    export const Token = "<#YOUR TEMP TOKEN HERE#>";
    ```

> To ensure communication security, Agora uses tokens (dynamic keys) to authenticate users joining a channel.
>
> Temporary tokens are for demonstration and testing purposes only and remain valid for 24 hours. In a production environment, you need to deploy your own server for generating tokens. See [Generate a Token](https://docs.agora.io/en/Interactive Broadcast/token_server)for details.

### Install dependencies and integrate the Agora Video SDK


1. Using the Terminal app, enter the `install` command in your project directory. This command installs libraries that are required to run the sample application.
    ``` bash
    # install dependencies
    npm install
    ```
2. Start the application by entering the `run dev` or `run build` command.
    The `run dev` command is for development purposes.
    ``` bash
    # serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
    npm run dev
    ```
    The `run build` command is for production purposes and minifies code.
    ``` bash
    # build for production with minification
    npm run build
    ```
3. Your default browser should open and display the sample application.
    **Note:** In some cases, you may need to open a browser and enter `http://localhost:8080` as the URL.
